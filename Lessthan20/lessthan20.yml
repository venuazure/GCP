description: 'if stratos is true. If it is, 
it retrieves all regions for a given GCP project, then iterates through each region to get its subnetworks. For each subnetwork, it fetches its details and extracts the CIDR notation and subnet mask. It then sets up a test to ensure the subnet mask is not less than 20, indicating that the subnet should be of a reasonable size (not too large in terms of the number of hosts)''
